Things to do
========

- Create database to store the audio fingerprints

- Create routes using Flask that will allow the node app to send the
the audio gathered audio fingerprint for comparison

    - This route should convert the post data into a DetectionEvent object
    
- Create Android app that will do the audio fingerprinting.

    - This should be able to record an arbitrary amount of audio and determine
    the fingerprint from it
    
- Create an easy way for users to add songs to the database to use for recognition

Things to do
========

- Create a "tree" based database lookup for identifying sounds so multiple
sounds can represent the same "class"

- Remember, you are breaking up the sounds into sound classes because it
provides a larger search space for the sound recognition and is more
resiliant to changes in the sound. The reference data for each sound in
the sound class is averaged and that is used for the initial guess this
assumes that a chicken will always be as loud as a chicken.
